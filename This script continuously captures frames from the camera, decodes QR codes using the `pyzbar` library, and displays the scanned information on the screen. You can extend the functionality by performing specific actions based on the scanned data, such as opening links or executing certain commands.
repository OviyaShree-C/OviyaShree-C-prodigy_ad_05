Creating a full-fledged QR code scanner app with camera integration requires a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit like Tkinter, Kivy, PyQt, or libraries like OpenCV for camera access and decoding QR codes. Here's a basic example using the `pyzbar` library for QR code decoding and `OpenCV` for camera access:

First, you need to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless pyzbar
```

Here's a simple Python script for a QR code scanner app:

```python
import cv2
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode

def scan_qr_code():
    camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    while True:
        _, frame = camera.read()
        decoded_objects = decode(frame)

        for obj in decoded_objects:
            data = obj.data.decode('utf-8')
            print("Scanned QR code:", data)
            # Perform actions based on the scanned data here

            # Display the scanned data on the screen
            cv2.putText(frame, data, (50, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255, 0, 0), 2)

        cv2.imshow("QR Code Scanner", frame)
        key = cv2.waitKey(1)

        if key == 27:  # ESC key to exit
            break

    camera.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scan_qr_code()
```
